# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a 22-year-old maker, and I love building things.

I work at [World](https://world.org/), building anonymous proof of humanity and deepfake protection.

In my free time, I like to [build](https://miguel.build). Here's a few of my favourite open-source projects:

- [cog-rust](https://github.com/m1guelpf/cog-rust): Rust containers for machine learning.
- [ensemble](https://github.com/m1guelpf/ensemble): A Laravel-inspired ORM for Rust.
- [commit](https://github.com/m1guelpf/commit): A command palette-style Git client for blazing-fast commits.

- [auto-commit](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-commit): Rust CLI that automatically writes commit messages for you, built in Rust.
