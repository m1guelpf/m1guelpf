# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a 20-year-old maker, and I love building things.

I work at [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/), building the most scalable & private sybil-resistance solution. Before that I worked at [Showtime](https://showtime.io/?ref=miguel), an NFT social network.

On my free time, I like to [write](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/articles), and build lots of side projects. Here are a few:

- [chatgpt-telegram](https://github.com/m1guelpf/chatgpt-telegram): A Go CLI to run your own ChatGPT Telegram bot.
- [lil-web3](https://github.com/m1guelpf/lil-web3): Simple, intentionally-limited versions of web3 protocols & apps.
- [auto-commit](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-commit): Rust CLI that automatically writes commit messages for you, built in Rust.
- [yt-whisper](https://github.com/m1guelpf/yt-whisper): Automatically generate subtitles for YouTube videos, using OpenAI's Whisper.
- [plz-cli](https://github.com/m1guelpf/plz-cli): Copilot for your terminal
- [php-evm](https://github.com/m1guelpf/php-evm): A PHP implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, because why not.
